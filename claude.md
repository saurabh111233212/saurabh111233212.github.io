# Claude Agent Rules

When working on this website:

1. **Always rebuild after changes**: Run `make dev` after making any changes to see them reflected
2. **Font**: We're using Rubik - friendly and chunky
3. **Colors**:
   - Primary: Violet purple (#7c3aed)
   - Warm peachy backgrounds in light mode (#fff4e6)
   - Warm brown backgrounds in dark mode (#1c1510)
4. **Vibe**: Warm, welcoming, a little fun - not sanitized/professional
5. **Accessibility**: We have skip links, ARIA labels, focus states - keep maintaining these
6. **No gradients**: We removed the ugly blue-purple gradients, keep things solid

## Important Notes
- This site is vibe-coded
- The fun mode (floating animals) should cleanly toggle on/off
- External links need `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
